### 1.4.0

* 2022/01/17 - Started a Changelog.md file. I got motivated.
  * Hey, I tested this build with v9.242, and it works! (I hope)
  * See any issues with Foundry Versions 0.8.9 thru 9.242, please let us know at MHP Discord.
* Added fonts to Journal Entries to see how I/others like them.
* Replaced colors and background textures from an earlier build.
* Will be slowly replacing features that were removed for... reasons.
  * I could use some help over at dark-matter-compendium. Look there for "[Issues](https://gitlab.com/dark-matter1/dark-matter-compendium/-/issues)" that you could help out with.
* Edited the README.md file. Corrected some minor errors, made reference to Foundry v9, etc.
